Projects can be found hosted live respective of their titles at:

https://codepen.io/chocolatechimpcookie/

I am hosting them here and there because I prefer writing my projects
in my desktop environment as opposed to codepen's environment
and because freecodecamp requests them to be hosted there
for evaluation purposes.
